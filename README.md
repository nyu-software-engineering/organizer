<h1>Organizer</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Organizer is a web application that tracks down students' assignments from NYU Classes and organize them into a website so students do not neccessarily have to log in to NYU Classes and check for assignments for each of their courses. The web app also intends to provide insights on students' performance on doing different assignments. Additionally, it provides a time prediction on finishing upcoming tasks. This application is designed to help students make the most out of their time.</p>
  
  
 <h2>History</h2>
 <p>As NYU students who are aware of how time consuming tracking down all assignments from NYU Classes can be. We would like to develop a tool to help students organize upcoming assignments so that they do not have to constantly log into NYUClasses and check for new published assignments.</p>
